# ARDUINO_EEG
An EEG reader and wavelet renderer for my Arduino EEG project.

This little Arduino applet can read EEG signal provided by ARDUINO and visualize it.

The hardware I used is described by Chipstein (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chipstein/home-page/eeg-with-an-arduino">Link</a>)

This was only tested on Win7 and Win10.
