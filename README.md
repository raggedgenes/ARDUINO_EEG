# ARDUINO_EEG
An EEG reader and wavelet renderer for my Arduino EEG project.

This little Arduino applet can read EEG signal provided by ARDUINO and visualize it.

The hardware I used is described by Chipstein. (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/chipstein/home-page/eeg-with-an-arduino">Link</a>)

The wavelet transform code is a modified version of Steve Hanov's Wavelet Sound Explorer. (<a href="http://stevehanov.ca/wavelet/">Link</a>)

This was only tested on Win7 and Win10.
